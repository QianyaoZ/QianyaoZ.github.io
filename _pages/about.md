Hi, this is Qianyao Zhu, a PhD student at the University of Minnesota! 

I hope to do some creative work during my PhD. My current interest lies in condensed matter theory, specifically focusing on strong-correlated many-body systems. My advisor now is Prof. Natalia Perkins (I'm hoping, begging, praying that I can follow her throughout my whole PhD life)

My biggest hope is to survive (it has multiple meanings, could be my PhD student life, or the life in the US, or the path after this stage...).

I don't know how to translate the following sentences. If you understand Chinese, you can take them as Easter eggs:

在世界中心呼唤凉宫春日的怪兽。

终极目标是成为一名硬核狠人。
